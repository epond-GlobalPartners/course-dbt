wk 1:
1) 130 users
2) 7.680851 orders/hr
3) 3.891803278689 days from order to delivery
4) 1 order: 25 users 2 orders: 28 users 3+ users: 71 users
5) 16.327586 sessions/hr


wk 2:
1) repeat user rate = 0.798387 or ~80%
2) all of the following would have a positive indicator of repeat purchases if the number is high and the inverse if the number is low:
    - number of page hits per user
    - length of activity
3) my product mart was formulated with events & products being joined at the intermediate layer then adding additional business transformations & logic at the fact layer.  I did this in mind of what I think should be exposed in BI applications to other analysts vs. what dimensionality I want to keep further upstream.
4) testing: I checked for null values both at the stg layer and int/fact layer.  no issues in calculating page views by product, though I do see what appear to be placeholder item names.  not sure how I would test for that other than filtering it out. 
5) snapshots: 
the following products had w/w inventory changes:
- Monstera
- Pothos
- Philodendron
- String of pearls
